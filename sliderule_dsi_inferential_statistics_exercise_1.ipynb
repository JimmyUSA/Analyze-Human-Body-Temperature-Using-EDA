    "    <li> Although this is not a requirement for the Central Limit Theorem to hold (read the introduction on Wikipedia's page about the CLT carefully: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem), it gives us some peace of mind that the population may also be normally distributed if we assume that this sample is representative of the population.\n",
    "    <li> Think about the way you're going to check for the normality of the distribution. Graphical methods are usually used first, but there are also other ways: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normality_test\n",
    "    </ul>\n",
    "<li>  Is the sample size large? Are the observations independent?\n",

    "    <ul>\n",
    "    <li> First, try a bootstrap hypothesis test.\n",
    "    <li> Now, let's try frequentist statistical testing. Would you use a one-sample or two-sample test? Why?\n",

    "    <li> Now try using the other test. How is the result be different? Why?\n",
